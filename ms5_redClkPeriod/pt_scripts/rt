[1mARGUMENTS[0m
       -from [4mfrom_list[0m
              Reports only paths that start from the specified list  of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or from startpoints clocked by
              the named clocks. Valid startpoints are clock pins of sequential
              devices and input pins of the design.

       -rise_from [4mrise_from_list[0m
              Same as the [1m-from [22moption, except that the path must start with a
              rising transition. If you specify a  clock  object,  the  option
              selects startpoints clocked by the named clock and launched by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_from [4mfall_from_list[0m
              Same  as  the [1m-rise_from [22moption, except that the path must start
              with a falling transition.

       -to [4mto_list[0m
              Reports only paths that end  at  the  specified  list  of  pins,
              ports,  nets,  or cell instances; or at endpoints clocked by the
              named clocks. Valid endpoints are data input pins of  sequential
              devices and output pins of the design.

              Due to the infrastructure of the timing analyzer, the [1m-to [22moption
              runs more efficiently than the [1m-from [22moption. As a  result,  end-
              point-oriented  reporting  flows (based on using the [1m-to [22moption)
              outperform equivalent startpoint-oriented reporting flows (based
              on using the [1m-from [22moption).

       -rise_to [4mrise_to_list[0m
              Same  as the [1m-to [22moption, except that the path data must end with
              a rising transition. If you specify a clock object,  the  option
              selects  endpoints  clocked by the named clock and captured by a
              rising edge of the  clock  at  the  clock  source,  taking  into
              account any logical inversions along the clock path.

       -fall_to [4mfall_to_list[0m
              Same  as the [1m-rise_to [22moption, except that the path data must end
              with a falling transition.

       -through [4mthrough_list[0m
              Reports only paths in which the  data  goes  through  the  named
              pins,  ports,  cell  instances, or nets. You can use this option
              multiple times in a command.

              When a single [1m-through [22mlist contains multiple objects, the  data
              path  can go through any one of the listed objects. When you use
              multiple [1m-through [22moptions, the data path must meet each  of  the
              [1m-through [22moptions in sequence.

              For example, the following command reports a path that starts at
              A1, then passes through either B1 or B2, then passes through C1,
              and ends at D1.

                pt_shell> [1mreport_timing -from A1 -through {B1 B2} -through C1 -to D1[0m

              If  advanced  analysis  through  transparent  latches is enabled
              ([1mtiming_enable_through_paths [22mset to [1mtrue[22m), and the  pins  speci-
              fied  in  the  last through switch are latch loop breakers, then
              the timing paths reported are constrained by the  worst  of  the
              closing edges at the latch or by a required value computed using
              logic downstream of the latch loop  breaker.   The  latter  con-
              straint is called "time required through endpoint" in the timing
              report, and the latch is said to be constrained  by  "downstream
              required."

       -rise_through [4mrise_through_list[0m
              Same  as  the  [1m-through  [22moption,  except that it applies only to
              paths with a rising transition at the specified objects.

       -fall_through [4mfall_through_list[0m
              Same as the [1m-through [22moption, except  that  it  applies  only  to
              paths with a falling transition at the specified objects.

       -exclude [4mexclude_list[0m
              Excludes  all  paths in which the data goes from, through, or to
              the specified list of pins, ports, nets, or cell  instances;  or
              excludes  all  paths belonging to the specified list of path tag
              sets. It checks only data paths (not clock paths)  for  excluded
              objects.

              Using  the  [1m-exclude  [22moption  can result in significantly longer
              runtimes.   To  reduce  the  runtime  impact,  use  this  option
              together  with  other  topological  restriction  options such as
              [1m-from [22mand [1m-through[22m.

              The [1m-exclude [22moption does not check borrowing paths considered by
              the [1m-trace_latch_borrow [22moption.

       -rise_exclude [4mrise_exclude_list[0m
              Same  as the [1m-exclude [22moption, but applies only to rising transi-
              tions at the named pins, ports, nets, or cell instances.

       -fall_exclude [4mfall_exclude_list[0m
              Same as the [1m-exclude [22moption, but applies only to rising  transi-
              tions at the named objects.

              You  can use no more than one of the [1m-exclude[22m, [1m-rise_exclude[22m, or
              [1m-fall_exclude [22moptions in a command.

       -delay_type [4mdelay_type[0m
              Specifies the type of path  delay  constraint  to  consider  for
              finding and sorting paths with the worst slack:
              o [1mmax [22m(default) -- max delay (setup constraint)
              o [1mmin  [22m-- min delay (hold constraint)
              o  [1mmin_max   [22m--  both min and max delay (reported min first, max
                second)
              o [1mmax_rise  [22m-- max delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o [1mmax_fall  [22m-- max delay, falling at data path endpoint
              o [1mmin_rise  [22m-- min delay, rising at data path endpoint
              o [1mmin_fall  [22m-- min delay, falling at data path endpoint

       -nworst [4mpaths_per_endpoint[0m
              Reports up to the specified number of worst paths per  endpoint.
              The  default is 1. A larger value results in a larger report and
              more runtime. Allowed values are 1 to 2000000.

              If you set [1m-nworst [22mto any number greater  than  1,  the  command
              automatically does the following:

              o Implicitly sets [1m-max_paths [22mequal to the [1m-nworst [22msetting if the
                [1m-max_paths [22moption is not used in the command, so that at least
                one set of multiple paths to an endpoint can be reported
              o    Implicitly    sets    [1m-slack_lesser_than    0.0    [22mif   the
                [1m-slack_lesser_than [22mand  [1m-slack_greater_than  [22moptions  are  not
                used in the command, so that only violating paths are reported

       -max_paths [4mmax_path_count[0m
              Reports  up  to the specified maximum total number of paths.  If
              the [1m-group [22moption  is  specified,  the  total  number  of  paths
              reported  is  at  most  the  specified  number of paths per path
              group.  If the [1m-group [22moption is not specified, the total  number
              of paths reported is at most the specified number of paths among
              all path groups.  The default is equal to the  [1m-nworst  [22msetting,
              or  1 if the [1m-nworst [22moption is not used. The [1mmax_path_count [22mmust
              be greater than zero.

              If you set [1m-max_paths [22mto any number greater than 1, the  command
              implicitly sets [1m-slack_lesser_than 0.0 [22mif the [1m-slack_lesser_than[0m
              and [1m-slack_greater_than [22moptions are not used in the command,  so
              that only violating paths are reported.

              The [1m-nworst [22moption controls the maximum number of paths reported
              [4mper[24m [4mendpoint[24m, whereas the [1m-max_paths [22moption controls the [4moverall[0m
              [4mtotal[24m  [4mmaximum[24m [4mnumber[24m of paths reported.  The [1m-max_paths [22msetting
              should be at least as  large  as  the  [1m-nworst  [22msetting,  so  by
              default the tool implicitly sets [1m-max_paths [22mto the same value as
              [1m-nworst [22mif you do not use the [1m-max_paths [22moption in the command.

       -group [4mgroup_name[0m
              Reports only paths that belong to  the  specified  path  groups.
              Path  groups are created by the [1mcreate_clock [22mand [1mgroup_path [22mcom-
              mands. Without the  [1m-group  [22moption,  the  [1mreport_timing  [22mcommand
              reports  paths without considering path groups. For example, the
              [1mreport_timing [22mcommand alone reports the single worst path in the
              design,  whereas  [1mreport_timing -group [get_path_groups] [22mreports
              the single worst path [4min[24m [4meach[24m [4mpath[24m [4mgroup[24m.

       -unique_pins
              Reports only the single worst  timing  path  through  any  given
              sequence  of  pins.  No  other  paths  are reported for the same
              sequence of pins from startpoint to endpoint.  For  example,  if
              the  worst  path starts with a rising edge at the first pin of a
              pin sequence, then paths starting with a falling  edge  are  not
              reported for that sequence of pins.

              For non-unate logic such as XOR gates, using this option greatly
              reduces the number of paths reported because of the large number
              of   possible  rising/falling  edge  combinations  through  each
              sequence of pins.

              Using this option can require longer runtimes when used with the
              [1m-nworst  [22moption  because many paths must be analyzed to find the
              worst path through each pin sequence, but only the worst path is
              reported and counted toward the total number of requested paths.

       -slack_greater_than [4mminimum_slack[0m
              Reports  only  paths with slack greater than the specified [4mmini-[0m
              [4mmum_slack[24m value; these paths have a negative slack  better  than
              the  specified  [4mminimum_slack[24m value (or a positive slack that is
              farther from causing a violation). This option is intended to be
              used with the [1m-slack_lesser_than [22moption to report paths within a
              specific range of slack.

       -slack_lesser_than [4mmaximum_slack[0m
              Reports only paths with slack  less  than  the  specified  [4mmaxi-[0m
              [4mmum_slack[24m  value;  these  paths have a negative slack worse than
              the specified [4mmaximum_slack[24m value (or a positive slack  that  is
              closer to causing a violation).

              By  default,  the  [1mreport_timing [22mcommand reports the single path
              with the worst slack; or if the [1m-nworst [22mor [1m-max_paths [22moption  is
              set  to  a value greater than 1, the command considers all paths
              with negative slack, as if [1m-slack_lesser_than [22mis set to 0.0.

              The [1m-slack_lesser_than [22mand [1m-slack_greater_than  [22moptions  act  as
              filters  to  restrict the paths that are reported, so the number
              of paths reported can be fewer than the  number  specified  with
              the  [1m-nworst [22mand [1m-max_paths [22moptions.  If no paths meet the slack
              criteria, no paths are reported.

       -ignore_register_feedback [4mfeedback_slack_cutoff[0m
              Ignores noninverting timing loops that start and end at the same
              register pin that holds a value. To be ignored, the data-to-out-
              put arc and the output-to-data path must be either both  invert-
              ing  or both noninverting.  This option applies to minimum delay
              as well as maximum delay constraints. Paths are ignored only  if
              they  have a slack less than the specified [4mfeedback_slack_cutoff[0m
              value.

              This option acts as a filter to  restrict  the  paths  that  are
              reported, so the number of paths reported might be less than the
              number specified with the [1m-nworst [22mand [1m-max_paths [22moptions.

       -report_ignored_register_feedback
              Displays a list of ignored paths when you use the [1m-ignore_regis-[0m
              [1mter_feedback [22moption.

       -include_hierarchical_pins
              Causes  the timing path report to show points for the hierarchi-
              cal pins crossed, as well as all leaf  pins  in  the  path.  The
              hierarchical  pins  are  shown  only for documentation purposes;
              they are reported as having zero incremental delay  and  do  not
              affect the timing results.

       -trace_latch_borrow
              Controls  the type of report generated for a path that starts at
              a transparent latch. If the path  startpoint  borrows  from  the
              previous  path  segment,  using this option causes the report to
              show the set of borrowing paths that lead up  to  the  borrowing
              latch,  starting  with  a  nonborrowing  path  or a noninverting
              sequential loop. Each path segment is reported separately, show-
              ing  the  time  borrowed  and lent and the endpoints of the path
              segment.

              Without the [1m-trace_latch_borrow [22moption,  the  command  does  not
              include  upstream borrowing latches when in default latch analy-
              sis mode or borrowing latch loop breakers when in advanced latch
              analysis mode ([1mtiming_enable_through_paths [22mvariable set to true)
              as path segments in the timing report.

       -trace_latch_forward
              Controls the type of report generated for a path that ends at  a
              transparent  latch D pin. If advanced analysis through transpar-
              ent latches is enabled ([1mtiming_enable_through_paths  [22mis  set  to
              true) and this transparent latch D pin is constrained by a down-
              stream required time, this option causes the report to show  the
              paths  in  the  fanout  of this D pin that led to the downstream
              required constraint. These paths can include multiple path  seg-
              ments  whereby  the  constraint  is  the  result  of propagating
              through more  than  one  latch  constrained  by  the  downstream
              required time. In this case, each path segment is reported sepa-
              rately, showing the downstream required time for that path  seg-
              ment.

              Without  the  [1m-trace_latch_forward  [22moption, the command does not
              trace the path beyond the specified endpoint.

       -pba_mode none | path | exhaustive | ml_exhaustive
              Specifies one of the following path-based timing analysis modes:

              o [1mnone [22m(the default) - Disables path-based analysis and  enables
                ordinary graph-based analysis. This is the fastest mode.
              o  [1mpath  [22m- Performs path-based analysis on paths after they have
                been gathered by graph-based analysis, producing more accurate
                timing results for those paths. To control the ordering of the
                paths (either by original graph-based  slack  or  recalculated
                path-based  slack),  set  the  [1mpba_path_mode_sort_by_gba_slack[0m
                variable.
              o [1mexhaustive [22m- Performs an  exhaustive  path-based  analysis  to
                determine  the  truly worst-case paths in the design.  This is
                the most accurate and most  computation-intensive  mode.   You
                cannot   use   the   [1mexhaustive   [22mmode   together   with   the
                [1m-start_end_pair[22m, [1m-cover_design[22m, or [4mpath_collection[24m options.
              o [1mml_exhaustive [22m- Performs  Machine  Learning  based  exhaustive
                path-based analysis. This mechanism will deploy machine learn-
                ing techniques to trade runtime vs accuracy during the  design
                flow.   Accuracy and runtime will match pba_mode exhaustive as
                the design approaches signoff.

              In ordinary graph-based (default) timing analysis, the tool con-
              siders both the worst arrival time and worst slew among all sig-
              nals feeding into a path, even when the worst arrival and  worst
              slew come from different signals.

              In  path-based  timing analysis, the tool considers each path in
              isolation from other paths, which eliminates impossible combina-
              tions  of worst slew and worst arrival, and similar combinations
              of effects such as crosstalk and CRPR. As a  result,  path-based
              analysis reduces pessimism and increases accuracy at the cost of
              more runtime.

       -start_end_type [4mfrom_to_type[0m
              Restricts the report to one of four classes of  paths  based  on
              the type of startpoint and endpoint:

              o [1mreg_to_reg [22m- from register to register

              o [1mreg_to_out [22m- from register to output port

              o [1min_to_reg [22m- from input port to register

              o [1min_to_out [22m- from input port to output port

              In  this  description,  "register" means any valid startpoint or
              endpoint that is not an input port,  output  port,  or  bidirec-
              tional  port,  even if not a sequential register. For example, a
              clock-gating check endpoint qualifies as  a  "register"  in  the
              [1min_to_reg  [22mfrom-to  type. A bidirectional port qualifies as both
              an input port and an output port.

       -normalized_slack
              Gathers, sorts, and reports paths using normalized slack instead
              of  absolute  slack.  Normalized  slack  is  the  absolute slack
              divided by an  idealized  maximum  allowable  propagation  delay
              (typically  the  clock  period).  To use this option, the timing
              update  must  be  performed  while   the   [1mtiming_enable_normal-[0m
              [1mized_slack [22mvariable is set to [1mtrue[22m.

       -start_end_pair
              Reports  the worst path for each startpoint-endpoint pair in the
              design, including all  violating  startpoint-endpoint  pairs  by
              default,  or all startpoint-endpoint pairs with slack worse than
              the value specified by the  [1m-slack_lesser_than  [22moption  if  that
              option  is  used.  The  number  of  paths reported is limited to
              2000000 unless [1m-max_paths [22mis used to exceed this.

              The [1m-start_end_pair [22moption overrides  the  default  behavior  of
              reporting only the single worst path in the design. Instead, the
              command reports the worst timing path of each  violating  start-
              point-endpoint pair, which can result in a very large report and
              long runtimes. (Note that the Design Compiler  and  IC  Compiler
              tools differ from this behavior by respecting the default limits
              on the number of paths reported and by  allowing  usage  of  the
              [1m-nworst [22mand [1m-max_paths [22mwith [1m-start_end_pair[22m.)

              To  limit the report size and runtime to reasonable amounts, use
              the [1m-slack_lesser_than [22moption and specify a slack limit that  is
              only  slightly  greater than the worst slack in the design.  You
              can also restrict the scope of the analysis by using the  [1m-from[22m,
              [1m-to[22m,  and  similar  options.  You cannot use the [1m-start_end_pair[0m
              option   with    the    [1m-nworst[22m,    [1m-max_paths[22m,    [1m-unique_pins[22m,
              [1m-slack_greater_than[22m, or [1m-ignore_register_feedback [22moptions.

              The [1m-start_end_pair [22moption sorts the paths first by endpoint and
              then by slack, with the paths sharing the same endpoint reported
              together in order of increasing slack.

       -cover_design
              Reports the worst path through each violating pin in the design,
              so that the reported paths cover  every  violating  pin  in  the
              design.  A  pin  is  deemed to be violating if its slack is less
              than  zero,  or  less  than  the  value   specified   with   the
              [1m-slack_lesser_than [22moption if that option is used. The slack of a
              pin is the worst slack among  all  paths  that  start  at,  pass
              through,  or  end  on  that  pin.  The  maximum  number of paths
              reported
               is 2000000 unless [1m-max_paths [22mis used to exceed this.

              The following options cannot be used with [1m-cover_design[22m:

              [1m-nworst[0m
              [1m-max_paths[0m
              [1m-unique_pins[22m,

              [1m-report_ignored_register_feedback[0m
              [1m-start_end_pair[0m
              [1m-pba_mode exhaustive[0m
              [4mpath_collection[0m

       -cover_through [4mthrough_list[0m
              Reports the single worst violating  path  through  each  of  the
              named  pins,  ports,  cell  instances, and nets. Only paths with
              negative slack are reported (or with slack less than  the  value
              specified by the [1m-slack_lesser_than [22moption, if used).

              The number of paths reported is less than or equal to the number
              of objects in the [4mthrough_list[24m.  Fewer  paths  are  reported  if
              there  are  no  violating  paths  through the objects, or if the
              worst path through one object is the  same  as  the  worst  path
              through another object; duplicate paths are combined into a sin-
              gle path report.

              The following options cannot be used with [1m-cover_through[22m:

              [1m-nworst[0m
              [1m-max_paths[0m

              [4mpath_collection[0m

       -dont_merge_duplicates
              Prevents the merging of duplicate paths across multiple  scenar-
              ios  when the PrimeTime tool is invoked with the [1m-multi_scenario[0m
              option.

              By default, when the same path is reported in more than one sce-
              nario,  the  tool reports only the single most critical instance
              of that path in the merged report and shows its associated  sce-
              nario.

              If  you  use  this  option,  the  tool  does not merge duplicate
              instances of the same path, but  instead  reports  all  critical
              instances  of the path from all scenarios. Because the number of
              paths reported might limited by [1m-nworst[22m,  [1m-max_paths[22m,  or  other
              command  options,  the  resulting  merged  report  might be more
              focused on a portion of the design that is critical in  multiple
              scenarios,  and less evenly spread out across different portions
              of design.

       -pre_commands [4mpre_command_string[0m
              Specifies a list of commands, separated  by  semicolons,  to  be
              executed   in   the  worker  context  before  execution  of  the
              [1mreport_timing [22mcommand. This option  is  available  only  if  you
              invoke  the  PrimeTime tool with the [1m-multi_scenario [22moption. The
              maximum size of a command is 1000 characters.

       -post_commands [4mpost_command_string[0m
              This option is like the [1m-pre_commands [22moption,  except  that  the
              commands  are executed after (instead of before) the [1mreport_tim-[0m
              [1ming [22mcommand.

       -path_type [4mformat[0m
              Specifies the types of path information displayed in the  timing
              report, using one of the following format keywords:

              o  [1msummary  [22m--  Displays the path startpoint, path endpoint, and
                slack.
              o [1mend [22m-- Displays the path endpoint, path delay, required  time,
                and slack.
              o  [1mshort  [22m--  Displays a report like the default [1mfull [22mreport but
                omits the intermediate points between the startpoint and  end-
                point.
              o  [1mfull  [22m(the default) -- Displays the full data path, including
                all intermediate points and their incremental  and  cumulative
                delay,  together  with  the  launch  and capture clock arrival
                times, data required time, and slack.
              o [1mfull_clock [22m-- Displays a [1mfull [22mreport with the addition of  the
                clock path points from the clock source to the launch and cap-
                ture points.
              o [1mfull_clock_expanded [22m-- Displays a [1mfull_clock [22mreport  with  the
                addition  of  the  clock path points between the primary clock
                source and its related  generated  clock  source  point.  This
                report  is  different  from  a [1mfull_clock [22mreport only when the
                clock is a generated clock.

       -input_pins
              Shows cell input pins as well as cell output pins in the  timing
              path.   As  a  result,  the report shows the incremental net and
              cell delays separately at each point, instead of  combined.   By
              default, the report shows only the cell output pins.

       -nets  Shows  nets  in the timing path. By default, the report does not
              show nets.

       -nosplit
              Prevents line  splitting.  This  can  useful  for  scripts  that
              extract information from the report. By default, the report gen-
              erates a new line when the text cannot fit in the alloted  space
              in a column.

       -transition_time
              Shows  the  transition  time  (slew) in the path report for each
              driver pin and load  pin,  appearing  as  an  additional  column
              labeled "Trans". By default, the report does not show transition
              time.

       -capacitance
              Shows the total capacitance in the path  report  for  each  net,
              appearing as an additional column labeled "Cap". By default, the
              report does not show capacitance.

              The reported value is either the CCS receiver  capacitance  (the
              default)   or   the   lumped   capacitance,   depending  on  the
              [1mreport_capacitance_use_ccs_receiver_model [22mvariable setting.

       -significant_digits [4mdigits[0m
              Specifies the number of digits after the decimal point displayed
              for  time  values  in  the  generated report. Allowed values are
              0-13; the default is determined by  the  [1mreport_default_signifi-[0m
              [1mcant_digits  [22mvariable, which is 2 by default. Use this option if
              you want to override the default for the  current  report.  This
              option  controls  only  the  number of digits displayed, not the
              precision used internally for analysis.

       -crosstalk_delta
              Reports the annotated delta delay values at cell input pins in a
              column  labeled "Delta". The [1m-input_pins [22moption is automatically
              selected.  The delta values are computed during crosstalk signal
              integrity  analysis,  or they can be annotated manually by using
              the [1mset_annotated_delay -delta_only [22mand [1mset_annotated_transition[0m
              [1m-delta_only [22mcommands. Note that the [1m-crosstalk_delta [22moption only
              reports previously calculated or annotated delta values; it does
              not  initiate  crosstalk  analysis.   Delta transition times are
              also shown if you use the [1m-transition_time [22moption.

       -derate
              Shows derating factors in a column labeled "Derate". The default
              is to not show derating factors. Specifying this option automat-
              ically sets the [1m-input_pins [22moption, so that  different  net  and
              cell  derating  values are reported. When you use the [1m-path_type[0m
              [1mfull_clock_expanded [22moption, an additional summary report follows
              the  timing  report  showing  the overall effect of derating the
              path. Derating factors are always shown with at least  two  sig-
              nificant digits.

       -variation
              Includes  parametric on-chip variation (POCV) information in the
              report in columns labeled "Mean" and "Sensit". POCV analysis  is
              enabled  by setting the [1mtiming_pocvm_enable_analysis [22mvariable to
              [1mtrue[22m.

       -exceptions dominant | overridden | all
              Reports user-specified timing exceptions that are satisfied  per
              timing path being reported.

              Specifying dominant reports the dominant timing exception in the
              path.  It can be one of the following: false path,  minimum  and
              maximum delays, and multicycle paths.

              Specifying  overridden  reports  all  the timing exceptions that
              were overridden by the dominant timing exception.

              The unconstrained paths and their reason  is  reported  for  all
              three  options  if [1mtiming_report_unconstrained_paths [22mvariable is
              set to true, otherwise unconstrained paths will not be reported.

              To get more information about the exceptions that apply  to  the
              path, you can create a path collection with the [1mget_timing_paths[0m
              command and query certain timing path attributes.  For  details,
              see the man page for the [1mget_timing_paths [22mcommand.

              [1mNote[22m: The additional analysis required per path with the [1m-excep-[0m
              [1mtions [22moption can be significant, so you can expect a longer run-
              time.   This   option   cannot   be  used  with  the  [1m-path_type[0m
              [1mshort/end/summary [22moption.

       -voltage
              Reports the operating voltage for each path element in a  column
              labeled  "Voltage", allowing you to debug voltage levels in mul-
              tivoltage designs.  The displayed voltage is the voltage used in
              delay calculation, which is typically the voltage of the operat-
              ing condition, related supply net, related  power  pin,  or  pin
              signal.

       -supply_net_group
              Reports  the  supply  group or the supply net name for each path
              element in a column labeled "Supply-Net-Group".  If  the  supply
              net group name is not defined, the column shows the word "uncon-
              nected". If the supply group is not defined and the  supply  net
              name  is  available, then the supply net name is reported in the
              column along with the letter "n".

       -physical
              Reports the X-Y coordinates for each path element  in  a  column
              labeled  "Location".  The location information must be available
              from previous usage of  the  [1mread_parasitics  [22mcommand  with  the
              [1mread_parasitics_load_locations  [22mvariable set to true. If the X-Y
              coordinate data is not available for some or  all  of  the  ele-
              ments,  the  report  shows the string "unplaced" for the missing
              the data.

       -sort_by group | slack
              Specifies the sorting of the reported  paths,  either  by  [1mgroup[0m
              (the  default)  or by [1mslack[22m. Sorting by group means ordering the
              path reports by group, and within each group, by slack. Ordering
              by  slack  means  ordering  the  path reports strictly by slack,
              ignoring group membership.

       -tag_paths_filtered_by_pba [4mtag_name[0m
              When used with the [1m-pba_mode path  [22moption,  the  [1m-tag_paths_fil-[0m
              [1mtered_by_pba [22moption causes tagging of all paths originally found
              by path-based analysis and later discarded by path-based  analy-
              sis,  using  the  specified tag name. In future [1mget_timing_paths[0m
              and [1mreport_timing [22mcommands, you can  exclude  the  tagged  paths
              from  further analysis by specifying the tag name as an argument
              to the [1m-exclude [22moption.

       -imsa_session [4msession_name[0m
              This option can  only  be  used  in  [1mIMSA  [22mmode,  when  variable
              [1meco_update_path_timing [22mis enabled.  By default, [1mIMSA [22mreport_tim-
              ing will cover all  in-memory  timing-paths  collections.   When
              this  option  has been used, command will cover the timing-paths
              from specific session only.

       [4mpath_collection[0m
              Specifies a collection of timing paths to report, for example, a
              collection  previously  created by [1mset mypaths [get_timing_paths[0m
              [1m...][22m. When you use this option with the [1m-pba_mode  path  [22moption,
              the  command  performs  path-based  analysis on the paths in the
              [4mpath_collection[24m before they are reported.  This option is  mutu-
              ally  exclusive with options that control the selection of paths
              to report and is compatible only with the options  that  control
              the formatting of the report.

       -dvfs_scenarios [4mdvfs_scenarios_list[0m
              Specifies a collection of DVFS scenarios to analyze. Only timing
              paths compatible to the specified DVFS scenarios collection  are
              reported.   This  option  is  only available with SMVA analysis.
              This collection is created by [1mget_dvfs_scenarios[22m.

       -domain_crossing [4mdomain_crossing_mode[0m
              Specifies  the  domain  crossing  report  mode.  Allowed  values
              include  [4mall,[24m  [4monly_crossing,[24m [4mexclude_crossing[24m. The default mode
              is [4mall[24m.  This option is applied as a reporting filter,  ensuring
              that  only  paths which satisfy the specified mode are reported.
              With the default setting of [4mall[24m, all paths  are  considered  for
              reporting,  including  cross-domain  and  intra-domain. With the
              [4monly_crossing[24m mode, reports  include  only  cross-domain  paths.
              Using the [4mexclude_crossing[24m mode only reports intra-domain paths.
              This option is only available with SMVA analysis.

       -pocv_pruning
              Generate a path collection which contributes  to  joint  success
              rate.  This  option prunes away all subcritical paths which have
              no impact on high sigma failure rate.  The returned path collec-
              tion  will  be used in [1mget_design_variation [22mfor design variation
              analysis.

              This option can only work with the [1m-pba_mode exhaustive  [22moption.
              It  can significantly reduce runtime and memory in both [1mget_tim-[0m
              [1ming_paths [22mand [1mget_design_variation[22m. So we  recommend  to  always
              use  it if the generated path collection is for design variation
              analysis.

       -attributes [4mattribute_list[0m
              Specifies a list of timing point attributes to be printed inline
              with each timing point row.

       -vdd_slack
              Shows  voltage  slack and voltage sensitivity information in the
              report  for  path  collection  generated  with  get_timing_paths
              -vdd_slack_lesser_than.  The  [1m-vdd_slack  [22mmust  be used together
              with the [1mpath_collection [22moption.

       -vdd_slack_lesser_than [4mmaximum_vdd_slack[0m
              Performs Voltage slack analysis on the paths and  shows  voltage
              slack in the report if the value is less than the specified [1mmax-[0m
              [1mimum_vdd_slack value.[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The [1mreport_timing [22mcommand reports  the  timing  paths  in  the  current
       design  that have the worst slack. These are the paths that violate the
       timing constraints by the largest amounts, or paths with positive slack
       that come closest to causing a timing violation.

       Each path has a startpoint and an endpoint. Data is launched by a clock
       edge at the path startpoint, propagated through combinational logic  in
       the path, and then captured at the path endpoint by another clock edge.
       The startpoint can be a register clock pin or an input port.  The  end-
       point can be a register data input pin or an output port.

       To  restrict the scope of the report to only the paths that start, pass
       through, or end on specific pins, ports, nets, or cell  instances,  use
       the  [1m-from[22m,  [1m-though[22m,  and [1m-to [22moptions, and the similar transition-spe-
       cific options ([1m-rise_from[22m, [1m-fall_to[22m,  and  so  on).   To  restrict  the
       report  to  specific clocks, you can use the same options (for example,
       [1m-to [get_clocks CLK1][22m) or the [1m-group [22moption.

       By default, the [1mreport_timing [22mcommand without options reports the  sin-
       gle path in the design with the worst max delay (setup constraint) vio-
       lation.  To  consider  constraints  other  than  max  delay,  use   the
       [1m-delay_type  [22moption.  To  control the number of paths reported, use the
       [1m-nworst [22moption, which specifies  the  maximum  number  of  worst  paths
       reported  per  endpoint; and the [1m-max_paths [22moption, which specifies the
       overall maximum number of paths reported by the command.

       To report paths whose slack values fall within a  specific  range,  use
       the  [1m-slack_lesser_than  [22mand [1m-slack_greater_than [22moptions in combination
       with the [1m-nworst [22mand [1m-max_paths [22moptions.

       The default timing report shows the  point-to-point  sequence  of  cell
       output pins in the data path, as in the following example:

        Startpoint: I_ORCA_TOP/I_PCI_CORE/pad_en_reg
                     (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by PCI_CLK)
        Endpoint: pad[1] (output port clocked by PCI_CLK)
        Path Group: PCI_CLK
        Path Type: max

       The  report  shows the incremental delay contributed by each pin-to-pin
       segment of the path (Incr column) and the cumulative path delay  up  to
       each  pin  in  the  timing path (Path column). The table also shows the
       data launch clock arrival time, the data capture clock arrival time, an
       accounting of arrival time versus required time, and the resulting tim-
       ing slack for the path. A negative slack indicates a timing violation.

       To calculate the delay contributed by each point along  the  path,  the
       tool  considers any back-annotated RC network or SDF delay information.
       The types of back-annotated data on path elements in  the  timing  path
       are indicated by a character symbol in the Incr column:

         Symbol      Annotation
         ------      ----------
           H         Hybrid annotation
           ^         Ideal network latency annotation
           *         SDF back-annotation
           &         RC network back-annotation
           $         RC pi back-annotation
           +         Lumped RC
           @         HyperScale annotation
         [4mnone[24m        Wire-load model or none

       Certain  annotations dominate others. For example, SDF takes precedence
       over back-annotated RC parasitics. The symbol  displayed  in  the  Incr
       column indicates the dominant annotation on the path element.

       If  the  [1m-input_pins [22moption is used, the report includes the input pins
       as well as output pins of each cell in the path.  In  that  case,  each
       pin-to-pin  delay  spans  either a net or cell. Without the [1m-input_pins[0m
       option, the delay shown can span both a net and a cell. If the net  and
       cell  have  the  same  dominant  annotation,  the appropriate symbol is
       shown; otherwise, the "H" symbol indicates that a hybrid of  annotation
       types exists on the corresponding path segment.

       The  dominant  annotation is not necessarily the actual annotation used
       to calculate the delay.  For example, suppose that a back-annotated  RC
       network  exists on a net, but the network calculation fails to converge
       for the driver cell delay.  In that case, you get a warning message and
       a  lumped RC model is used instead.  However, in the timing report, the
       "&" symbol still reports the RC  network  annotation  as  the  dominant
       annotation.   To see the actual pin-to-pin delay calculation in detail,
       use the [1mreport_delay_calculation [22mcommand.

       To control the amount of detail provided in the  point-to-point  timing
       report, use the following options:

       o  [1m-path_type  [22m-- Specifies the report format: [1mshort[22m, [1mfull[22m, [1mfull_clock[22m,
         ...
       o [1m-input_pins [22m-- Lists the cell input pins (in addition to output pins)
         in the path
       o [1m-nets [22m-- Lists the nets (as well as pins) in the path
       o [1m-transition_time [22m-- Shows transition time (slew) in a separate column
       o [1m-capacitance [22m-- Shows capacitance values in a separate column
       o  [1m-crosstalk_delta [22m-- Shows annotated delta delay values in a separate
         column
       o [1m-derate [22m-- Shows derating factors in a separate column
       o [1m-variation [22m-- Shows POCV mean and sensitivity values in separate col-
         umns
       o [1m-voltage [22m-- Shows operating voltages in a separate column
       o [1m-physical [22m-- Shows XY coordinates a separate column

       To  invoke  path-based  analysis,  use the  [1m-pba_mode [22moption.  In path-
       based timing analysis, the tool considers each path in  isolation  from
       other paths, which eliminates impossible combinations of worst slew and
       worst arrival, and similar combinations of effects  such  as  crosstalk
       and  CRPR.  As  a  result,  path-based  analysis  reduces pessimism and
       increases accuracy at the cost of more runtime.
