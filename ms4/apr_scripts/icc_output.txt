Using the following target skews for global optimization:
  Corner 'max': 0.013 ns
Using the following target skews for incremental optimization:
  Corner 'max': 0.000 ns
Using the following optimization options:
  gate sizing                   :  on
  gate relocation               :  on
  preserve levels               :  off

  relax insertion delay         :  off
  balance rc                    :  off
Information: The -balance_rc option is set to false by default, because there are single CTS corner(s). (CTS-1121)
