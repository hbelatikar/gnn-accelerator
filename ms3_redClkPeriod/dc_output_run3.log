       [1mLINT-2  [22m(warning)  In  design  '%s', net '%s' driven by pin '%s' has no
       loads.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This warning message occurs when a net is driven by an output  pin  (or
       pins)  but  has  no  load pins connected to it.  This usually indicates
       that a design is not correctly  specified.   The  Design  Compiler  may
       remove  such  nets and their driving components from your design unless
       they are protected by a don't touch attribute.

[1mWHAT_NEXT[0m
       This is only a warning message.  You can eliminate this warning message
       by following the instructions below.

       Make  sure  that  you  want the named net to exist in the given design,
       even though it has no load pins connected.  If so, add  a  don't  touch
       attribute  with  the  [1mdont_touch  [22mcommand  to  keep  the net from being
       removed.

       Check the value of the [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name [22mvariable.  For some  set-
       tings, signals without drivers or loads are preserved in the elaborated
       design.  Check the [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name [22mman page  for  more  informa-
       tion.

       [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name[0m
              Determines whether HDL Compiler attempts to keep a signal name.

[1mTYPE[0m
       string

[1mDEFAULT[0m
       all_driving

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The  [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name  [22mvariable is available only in HDL Compiler
       (Presto Verilog) and HDL Compiler (Presto VHDL).  For this  discussion,
       these  tools  will be referred to as Presto.  The original HDL and VHDL
       compilers do not support [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name[22m.

       The value of [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name [22mdetermines whether Presto  attempts
       to keep a signal name.  This includes preserving cells between the sig-
       nal and the input or output port.  The [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name  [22mvariable
       provides  Presto  with guideline information for keeping a signal name,
       but it is not intended to be a 100% guarantee for keeping a signal.  In
       some  Presto optimizations, such as removing redundant code, the signal
       name may be optimized away, even if the signal is associated  with  the
       [1mkeep_signal_name  [22mattribute  or directive.  The allowed values are [1mall[22m,
       [1mnone[22m, [1muser[22m, [1muser_driving[22m, and [1mall_driving[22m,  as  described  below.   The
       [1muser [22mand [1muser_driving [22mvalues require the [1mkeep_signal_name [22mdirective.

       [1mnone   [22mPresto  does  not attempt to keep any signals.  This value over-
              rides the [1mkeep_signal_name [22mdirective.

       [1mall    [22mPresto attempts to preserve  a  signal  if  the  signal  is  not
              removed by optimizations.  Dangling and driving nets are consid-
              ered.  This value does not guarantee that a signal is kept.  The
              [1mall [22mvalue generally preserves fewer signals than the [1muser [22mvalue.
              For example, if there are 3 sequential nets named  [4mN1[24m,  [4mN2[24m,  and
              [4mN3[24m,  the  [1mall  [22mvalue  may keep only [4mN1[24m.  Setting [1mhdlin_keep_sig-[0m
              [1mnal_name [22mto the value of [1muser [22mand setting  the  [1mkeep_signal_name[0m
              directive on [4mN1[24m, [4mN2[24m, and [4mN3[24m generally keeps [4mN1[24m, [4mN2[24m, [4mN3[24m.

              This  value  may  cause the [1mcheck_design [22mcommand to issue LINT-2
              and LINT-3 warnings:

                Warning: In design '...', net '...' has no drivers.
                Logic 0 assumed.  (LINT-3)

                Warning: In design '...', net '...' driven by pin '
                (no pin) ' has no loads.  (LINT-2)

       [1mall_driving[0m
              Presto attempts to preserve  a  signal  if  the  signal  is  not
              removed  by  optimizations  and the signal is in an output path.
              Only driving nets are considered.  This value does not guarantee
              that  a  signal  is  kept.  For signals that are not in an input
              path (do not have drivers), Presto connects the input to ground,
              assuming logic 0 (ground) for the driver.

       [1muser   [22mThis  value  works  with the [1mkeep_signal_name [22mdirective.  Presto
              attempts to preserve a signal if the signal is  not  removed  by
              optimizations,  and  that  signal  is labeled with the [1mkeep_sig-[0m
              [1mnal_name [22mdirective.  Dangling and driving nets  are  considered.
              Although not guaranteed, Presto usually keeps the specified sig-
              nal for this configuration.

       [1muser_driving[0m
              This value works with the  [1mkeep_signal_name  [22mdirective.   Presto
              attempts  to  preserve  a signal if the signal is not removed by
              optimizations, the signal is in an output path, and  the  signal
              is  labeled  with  the [1mkeep_signal_name [22mdirective.  Only driving
              nets are considered.  Although not  guaranteed,  Presto  usually
              keeps  the specified signal for this configuration.  For signals
              that are not in an input path (do not have drivers), Presto con-
              nects  the  input  to  ground, assuming logic 0 (ground) for the
              driver.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       In Example 1, you  use  the  [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name  [22mvariable  and  the
       [1mkeep_signal_name  [22mdirective  to control what signals Presto attempts to
       preserve.

         Example 1 - Verilog

         module test (a, b, T,  A, c);
         input  [3:0]   a;
         input  [7:0]   b;
         input T;
         input A;
         output reg  [7:0] c;
         wire d, e;
         //synopsys async_set_reset "A"
         //synopsys keep_signal_name "e"

         assign e = ( a[3] & ~a[2] &  a[1] & ~a[0] );
         assign d = ( a[3] & ~a[2] &  a[1] & ~a[0] );

         always @(T or b or A or d)
         if (A)
              c = 8'h0;
                else if (T & d)
              c = b;
         endmodule

       The internal wire e is not kept if the line //synopsys keep_signal_name
       "e"  is  removed,  and  [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name  [22mis  either  [1mnone[22m, [1muser[22m,
       [1muser_driving[22m, or [1mall_driving[22m.  However, e is  kept  if  [1mhdlin_keep_sig-[0m
       [1mnal_name [22mis [1mall[22m.  Also, e is kept if [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name [22mis [1muser [22mand
       //synopsys keep_signal_name is attached to "e".

       In Example 2, by default Presto attempts  to  preserve  the  test1  and
       test2  signals  because  they are in output paths.  Note that the test2
       signal is not in an input path; Presto does not try to keep  the  test3
       signal  because it is not in an output path.  Presto optimizes away the
       [4msyn1[24m and [4msyn2[24m signals.

         Example 2 - Verilog

         module test12 (in1, in2, in3, in4, out1,out2 );
           input  [3:0]   in1;
           input  [7:0]   in2;
           input in3;
           input in4;
           output reg  [7:0] out1,out2;

           wire test1,test2, test3, syn1,syn2;

         //synopsys async_set_reset "in4"

           assign test1 = ( in1[3] & ~in1[2] & in1[1] & ~in1[0] );
          //test1 signal is in an input and output path
           assign test2 = syn1+syn2;
          //test2 signal is in a output path, but it is not in an input path
           assign test3 = in1 + in2;
          //test3 signal is in an input path, but it is not in an output path
           always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
           out2 = test2+out1;
           always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
               if (in4)
                 out1 = 8'h0;
               else
               if (in3 & test1)
                out1 =  in2;
         endmodule

       One way to keep the test3 signal is to  set  [1mhdlin_keep_signal_name  [22mto
       [1muser  [22mand  place  the  [1mkeep_signal_name [22mdirective on test3, as shown in
       Example 3.

         Example 3 - Verilog

         module test12 (in1, in2, in3, in4, out1,out2 );
           input  [3:0]   in1;
           input  [7:0]   in2;
           input in3;
           input in4;
           output reg  [7:0] out1,out2;

           wire test1,test2, test3, syn1,syn2;
         //synopsys keep_signal_name "test3"

         //synopsys async_set_reset "in4"

             assign test1 = ( in1[3] & ~in1[2] & in1[1] & ~in1[0] );
            //test1 signal is in an input and output path
             assign test2 = syn1+syn2;
            //test2 signal is in a output path, but it is not in an input path
             assign test3 = in1 + in2;
            //test3 signal is in an input path, but it is not in an output path
             always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
             out2 = test2+out1;
             always @(in3 or in2 or in4 or test1)
                 if (in4)
                   out1 = 8'h0;
                 else
                 if (in3 & test1)
                  out1 = in2;
         endmodule

       Table 1 shows how the variable settings affect the preservation of sig-
       nal test3, with and without the directive applied to it.  Asterisks (*)

              library  cells)  on which the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute is to be set,
              so that the objects will not be modified or replaced.   If  more
              than one object name is specified, each name must be enclosed in
              quotation marks (" ") or braces ({}).

       true | false
              Specifies the value with which to set the [1mdont_touch  [22mattribute.
              The default is [1mtrue[22m.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This  command sets the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute on cells, nets, references,
       designs in the current design, and on library cells, to prevent modifi-
       cation or replacement of these objects during optimization.

       Setting  the  [1mdont_touch  [22mattribute  on  a  hierarchical  cell  implies
       "dont_touch" on all cells below it that do not have [1mdont_touch  [22mset  to
       [1mfalse[22m.

       Setting the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute on a library cell implies "dont_touch"
       on all instances of that cell.  Setting the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute  on  a
       net  implies  "dont_touch" only on mapped combinational cells connected
       to that net.  All mapped combinational cells connected to the net  must
       be at the same level of hierarchy.

       Note  that  if the [1menable_keep_signal_dt_net [22mvariable is set to [1mtrue[22m, a
       different mechanism is used to preserve  a  dont_touch  net.   See  the
       enable_keep_signal_dt_net man page for more information.

       Setting the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute on a reference implies "dont_touch" on
       all cells of that reference  during  subsequent  optimizations  of  the
       design.

       Setting  the  [1mdont_touch  [22mattribute on a design has an effect only when
       the design is instantiated within another design as a level of  hierar-
       chy.   In  this case, "dont_touch" on the design implies that all cells
       under that level of hierarchy are "dont_touch."  Setting [1mdont_touch  [22mon
       the  top-level  design  has  no  effect  because it is not instantiated
       within any other design.

       Note the following information:

        o The [1mdont_touch [22mattribute is ignored on nets that have unmapped cells
         on them.

        o  The  [1mdont_touch [22mattribute applied by the tool on the cells and nets
         in the transitive fanout of [1mdont_touch_network [22mobjects overrides  the
         [1mfalse  dont_touch  [22mattribute  value that is set by the [1mset_dont_touch[0m
         command.  You can see the [1mdont_touch [22mvalue on cells or nets by  using
         the [1mreport_cell [22mor [1mreport_net [22mcommand.

        o  Setting  the  [1mdont_touch [22mattribute on unmapped cells in Design Com-
         piler topographical mode causes the  [1mcompile_ultra  [22mcommand  to  fail
         during execution.

        o  Setting  the  [1mdont_touch  [22mattribute  on selectops and their control
         logic is not supported if this logic resides at the top level of  the
         design.

        o  A [1mdont_touch [22mattribute on a clock gating cell or its parent hierar-
         chical cell will prevent clock gating optimizations from removing  or
         modifying it.

        o  The [1mdont_touch [22mattribute should be removed by [1mremove_attribute [22mcom-
         mand. It is not equivalent to [1mset_dont_touch [22mto false which will have
         its   meaning   depending  on  the  context.   E.g.  its  parent  has
         set_dont_touch is true.  In the DC Explorer flow,  [1mset_dont_touch  [22mto
         false  on  a  cell  will  be ignored if none of the cell's parent has
         [1mdont_touch [22mset to true.  In this case, the cell may be optimized away
         during  compile.  If the cell does not get optimized away during com-
         pile, the [1mdont_touch [22mfalse attribute may still be lost after compile.

       The [1mdont_touch [22mattribute affects DFT insertion as follows:

        o The [1mdont_touch [22mattribute indirectly affects DFT  insertion  by  pre-
         venting  the  cell  type  from  being changed. It is ignored for scan
         stitching, test signal routing, logic insertion. It is  also  ignored
         when an identified shift register is split by the scan architect; the
         head scan flip-flops of any new shift  register  segments  are  scan-
         replaced even if they have the [1mdont_touchfP attribute applied.[0m

        [1mo  A  dont_touch  attribute applied to a nonscan sequential cell keeps[0m
         [1mthe cell as a nonscan cell. It will not be scan-replaced or  stitched[0m
         [1minto scan chains. However, nonscan cells identified as shift register[0m
         [1melements can be stitched into scan chains.[0m

        [1mo A dont_touch  attribute  applied  to  a  test-ready  (scan-replaced)[0m
         [1msequential  cell  keeps the cell as a scan-replaced cell. If the cell[0m
         [1mis a valid scan cell, it will be stitched into scan  chains.  If  not[0m
         [1m(due  to  DRC violations or other directives such as set_scan_element[0m
         [1mfalse), it will remain as an unstitched test-ready cell.[0m

       When an object name is  specified,  the  [1mset_dont_touch  [22mcommand  first
       looks  within the current design for a cell that matches that name.  If
       it finds a match, a [1mdont_touch [22mattribute is assigned to that cell.   If
       no match is found, the command next looks within the current design for
       a net that matches  the  specified  name.   If  a  match  is  found,  a
       [1mdont_touch  [22mattribute  is  assigned to that net.  If no match is found,
       the command next looks for a reference, then a design  in  the  system,
       and  finally  for  a  library  cell  in  the system. The tool assigns a
       [1mdont_touch [22mattribute to the first object for which it finds a match.

       To remove the [1mdont_touch [22mattribute, use the [1mremove_attribute [22mcommand.

              designs specified in [4mdesign_list[24m. If [4mdesign_list[24m is  not  speci-
              fied,  the  current  design's  hierarchy is written. If a design
              hierarchy is not completely linked, the unresolved design refer-
              ences are not written out.

              If  the output format is ddc, block abstractions are not written
              out unless [4mdesign_list[24m consists of a single design that  is  the
              top   of   the  block  abstraction's  hierarchy.  Alternatively,
              [4mdesign_list[24m can be left empty if the current design is  the  top
              of  the block abstraction's hierarchy.  The [1m-hierarchy [22mand [1m-out-[0m
              [1mput [22moptions are required when writing block  abstractions  to  a
              .ddc file.

       -no_implicit
              Specifies  not  to  write  (save) the synthetic design hierarchy
              that is  implicitly  created  during  the  optimization  of  the
              design.   By  default, the command writes designs created in the
              hierarchy through the use of synthetic libraries even if you  do
              not use the [1m-hierarchy [22moption.

       -output [4moutput_file_name[0m
              Specifies a single file into which designs are to be written. By
              default, the command writes each design  into  a  separate  file
              named  [4mdesign[24m.[4msuffix[24m,  where  [4mdesign[24m  is the name of each design
              (with a full UNIX path) and [4msuffix[24m is the default suffix for the
              specified format. The default format suffixes and their descrip-
              tions are as follows:

                 [1m.ddc [22m- ddc
                 [1m.v   [22m- verilog
                 [1m.sv  [22m- svsim
                 [1m.vhd [22m- vhdl

              The [1m-output [22moption is required if the output format is .ddc  and
              a block abstraction hierarchy is being written.

       -scenarios [4mscenario_list[0m
              Lists scenarios whose constraints should be included in the out-
              put file.  This option applies to ddc format only.  By  default,
              the command includes all scenarios.

       -library [4mlibrary_name[0m
              Writes  the  Synopsys  database  format  object to the specified
              library.

       -include_anchor_cells
              Includes anchor cells created during linking (if any) when  gen-
              erating  Verilog output.  These are, by default, filtered out in
              Verilog output.  This option is supported only by DC Explorer.

       -exclude_references [4mreference_names[0m
              Specifies the reference cell names, separated by  space  charac-
              ters,  for  which  all  cell instances must not be written.  The
              [1m-exclude_references [22moption can only be  used  with  the  [1m-format[0m
              [1mverilog [22moption.

       -pg    Includes  PG  nets  and ports in Verilog output.  If the RTL was
              read with the [1mdc_allow_rtl_pg [22mvariable set  to  [1mtrue[22m,  the  data
              obtained  from  the original RTL is used.  Otherwise, PG connec-
              tions will be inferred from the design's UPF  specification,  if
              present.   For  more  information,  see the Design Compiler User
              Guide and the Power Compiler User Guide.   The  [1m-pg  [22moption  can
              only be used with the [1m-format verilog [22moption.

       [4mdesign_list[0m
              Lists  the designs or design files to be written. If [4mdesign_list[0m
              is omitted, the current design is used as the design list.

              Block abstractions are only written to .ddc files  when  exactly
              one  design is specified, or the current design is inferred, and
              that design is the top design of a block abstraction hierarchy.

              For other output formats, such as .v, if both block abstractions
              and  non-block  abstractions  exist in the design list, only the
              non-block abstractions are written out. However, if  only  block
              abstractions  exist  in  the design list, the block abstractions
              are written out.

              Designs are not removed from memory after they have  been  writ-
              ten;  to remove a design from memory, use the [1mremove_design [22mcom-
              mand.

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This command saves the designs from memory to disk.   If  a  design  is
       modified  in  the tool, you must use the [1mwrite_file [22mcommand to save the
       design.

   [1mMulticorner-Multimode Support[0m
       When writing in ddc format, constraint data for all scenarios is  saved
       by  default.   You  can  use the [1m-scenarios [22moption to specify a list of
       scenarios that should be saved.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       The following examples show how to save designs in ddc format.

       This example shows how to write out all designs in the current  hierar-
       chy.   Since  no  output file is specified, each design is written to a
       separate file using the design name as the base of the file name:

         prompt> [1mwrite_file -hierarchy[0m
         Writing ddc file 'top.ddc'
         Writing ddc file 'mid.ddc'
         Writing ddc file 'bot.ddc'

       This example shows how to save all designs in the current hierarchy  to
       a single file:

         prompt> [1mwrite_file -hierarchy -output ~bill/dc/designs.ddc[0m
         Writing ddc file '/home/bill/dc/designs.ddc'

       This example shows how to specify a list of designs to be saved:

         prompt> [1mwrite_file {ADDER MULT16}[0m
         Writing ddc file 'ADDER.ddc'
         Writing ddc file 'MULT16.ddc'

       This  example  shows another use of the [1m-hierarchy [22moption.  All designs
       in the hierarchies of designs A and B are written to a single file:

         prompt> [1mwrite_file -hierarchy -output ~bill/dc/two_hiers.ddc {A B}[0m
         Writing ddc file '/home/bill/dc/two_hiers.ddc'

       The following example shows how  to  specify  designs  by  listing  the
       design   file  name  instead  of  the  design  names  themselves.  (Use
       [1mlist_designs -show_file [22mto see the design names  associated  with  each
       file.)   It  writes  all  designs  that are associated with the top.ddc
       file.

         prompt> [1mwrite_file top.ddc[0m
         Writing ddc file 'top.ddc'.
         Writing ddc file 'mid.ddc'.
         Writing ddc file 'bot.ddc'.

       The following example shows how to resolve an ambiguous file name.   It
       is  possible  to  have multiple designs in memory with the same name if
       they are associated with different files.  To resolve the ambiguity you
       must  specify  the  design  in the form [4mfile_name[24m:[4mdesign_name[24m.  Use the
       absolute path to the file to avoid possible file  name  conflicts.   In
       the  following  example,  the  design  name "top" is ambiguous, and the
       ambiguity is resolved by using the file name:

         prompt> [1mwrite_file -output new.ddc top[0m
         Error: 'top' doesn't specify a unique design
                 Please use complete specification: full_file_name:design_name (UID-13)
         prompt> [1mwrite_file -output new.ddc /home/bill/dc/top.ddc:top[0m
         Writing ddc file 'new.ddc'
